# Finance-Tracker-Pro-
Student-built finance tracker prototype: PIN-only 6‑digit auth (first-time setup, then quick unlock), scan‑and‑save bills to transactions, transaction edit/delete with category filters, per‑category budgets, spending/income/trends analytics, and goals—data persists locally in the browser via localStorage (no backend).
